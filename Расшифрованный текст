CS:GO IS, TO THIS DAY, ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SHOOTER GAMES. DESPITE 
NOT BEING THE NEWEST FRANCHISE, THE FAN BASE IS STILL STRONG, AND 
WILLING TO SUPPORT THE GAME TILL THE END. HAVING THE POPULARITY
THAT IT DOES, IT’S NOT A SURPRISE TO SEE IT BEING ONE OF THE KINGS OF
ESPORTS, WITH VARIOUS TOURNAMENTS THAT FOCUS ON IT AND MANY PEOPLE
CS: GO BETTING ON MATCHES. BUT AS USUAL, EVEN IF YOU’RE ALREADY A
VETERAN OF THE GAME, THERE MAY STILL BE THINGS YOU’RE NOT AWARE OF.
NOBODY KNOWS ALL OF IT, AFTER ALL. HERE ARE SOME FUN FACTS TO KNOW
ABOUT CS:GO. 1. MESSAGE DISABLING IS POSSIBLE. ISN’T IT ANNOYING
WHEN PEOPLE ARE TROLLING IN THE CHAT, OR WHEN YOU RECEIVE A LOT OF
SPAM MESSAGES? THEY CAN BE DISTRACTING, AND VERY OFF-PUTTING WHEN
YOU’RE JUST TRYING TO ENJOY A GOOD OLD CS:GO MATCH. WELL, YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT DISABLING MESSAGES IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE.
IGNOREMSG WILL LET YOU DISABLE EVERYTHING, SO YOU CAN GO BACK TO
CONCENTRATING ON THE GAME. 2. NO COMPETITIVE MODE OR SKINS IN THE
FIRST GAME VERSION. PEOPLE WHO ARE HARDCORE CS:GO PLAYERS WOULD BE
MAD IF THE GAME TOOK AWAY THE SKINS OR COMPETITIVE MODE OPTIONS.
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE GAME HAS BECOME SUCH A POPULAR ESPORT, IT’S HARD
TO IMAGINE IT WITHOUT THESE OPTIONS. WELL, IN THE BEGINNING, WHEN
THE FIRST VERSION OF THE GAME WAS RELEASED, NONE OF THESE THINGS
EXISTED. IT WAS JUST A SIMPLE GAME, WITH NO SKINS AND MATCHMAKING. 
3.YOU CAN PULL OUT MONEY FROM THE OVERPASS ATM. DO YOU LIKE PLAYING ON
THE OVERPASS MAP? THEN THERE’S A LITTLE SECRET THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
OF. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN THE A BOMBSITE AREA WHILE IN DEATH-MATCH ON
OVERPASS, YOU ARE ABLE TO WITHDRAW MONEY FROM THE ATM. THERE IS A
BANK THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE MONEY, AND YOU CAN PULL OUT THE CASH
WITH THE “USE” BUTTON. PRETTY HELPFUL, ISN’T IT?
